## 📖 Description

Provide one or two paragraphs explaining the purpose, main features, and key technologies used:  
- **Framework**: Play Framework  
- **Language**: Scala  
- **Build Tool**: sbt  
- **Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)  
- **Additional Libraries**: (list any relevant libraries)

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java JDK 11+](https://adoptium.net/)  
- [sbt (Scala Build Tool)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)  
- (Optional) Docker and Docker Compose, if using containers for databases or deployment

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Compile and download dependencies**  
   ```bash
   sbt compile
   ```

3. **Start the application**  
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

   By default, the application will be available at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Set up environment variables or configuration files:

- Rename `conf/application.conf.example` to `conf/application.conf`.  
- Adjust database connection settings:
  ```hocon
  db.default.driver = "org.postgresql.Driver"
  db.default.url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database"
  db.default.username = "username"
  db.default.password = "password"
  ```
- (Optional) Configure ports, API keys, or other services in `conf/local.conf`.

---

## 💻 Running Locally

For active development, you can use:

```bash
sbt "~run"
```

This will recompile and restart the application automatically when code changes are detected.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
sbt test
```

To generate a code coverage report (if using scoverage):

```bash
sbt clean coverage test coverageReport
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

Describe how to package and deploy your application:

1. **Generate distributable**  
   ```bash
   sbt dist
   ```
2. **Upload and deploy**  
   - Copy the ZIP file (`target/universal/your-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`) to your server.  
   - Unzip it: `unzip your-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`.  
   - Run the script: `bin/your-project -Dplay.http.secret.key=your_secret_key`.

3. **Using Docker**  
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t your-username/your-project:latest .
     ```
   - Run the container:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 9000:9000        -e DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/db        -e SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key        your-username/your-project:latest
     ```
